# Vitis vinifera pathway expansion

In this project we had been given expression data of vitus vinifera genes, and part of flavonoid pathway. We had been asked to expand this pathway. One way of doing it is to apply feature selection methods. In this project I tried 3 methods: lasso lasso, randomized lasso randomized\_lasso and recursive feature elimination rfe with random forest random\_forest. The methodology and result can be found in report.

# Prerequisites

scipy stack, jupyter, r with package RankAggreg
